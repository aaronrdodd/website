## Languages

I study foreign languages in my spare time. So far I have reached an
advanced / conversational level in **Japanese**. I'm working to improve my
knowledge of **Romanian** but I'm still at a fairly rudimentary level.

## Programming

I like programming and studying algorithms in my spare time. My current go-to
hobbyist programming languages are **C\#**, **C++**, **Rust**, and **Lisp**.

I also like **Configuration as Code** and **Infrastructure as Code**.

All of my projects are available on my GitHub.
